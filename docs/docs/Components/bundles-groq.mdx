[Bundles](/components-bundle-components) contain custom components that support specific third-party integrations with Langflow.

This page describes the components that are available in the **Groq** bundle.

### Groq

This component generates text using Groq's language models.

1. To use this component in a flow, connect it as a **Model** in a flow like the [Basic prompting flow](/basic-prompting), or select it as the **Model Provider** if you're using an **Agent** component.

2. In the **Groq API Key** field, paste your Groq API key.
The Groq model component automatically retrieves a list of the latest models.
To refresh your list of models, click <Icon name="RefreshCw" aria-label="Refresh"/>.
3. In the **Model** field, select the model you want to use for your LLM.
This example uses [llama-3.1-8b-instant](https://console.groq.com/docs/model/llama-3.1-8b-instant), which Groq recommends for real-time conversational interfaces.
4. In the **Prompt** component, enter:
```text
You are a helpful assistant who supports their claims with sources.
```
5. Click **Playground** and ask your Groq LLM a question.
The responses include a list of sources.
