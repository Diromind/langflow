Langflow's **Agent** and **MCP Tools** components are critical for building agentic flows.
These components define the behavior and capabilities of AI agents in your flows.

## How agents work

Agents use LLMs as a reasoning engine to decide which of the connected tool components to use to solve a problem.

Tools in agentic functions are essentially functions that the agent can call to perform tasks or access external resources.
A function is wrapped as a `Tool` object with a common interface the agent understands.
Agents become aware of tools through tool registration where the agent is provided a list of available tools typically at agent initialization. The `Tool` object's description tells the agent what the tool can do.

The agent then uses a connected LLM to reason through the problem to decide which tool is best for the job.

## Sample agentic flows

The [**Simple agent starter flow** template](/simple-agent) demonstrates a basic agentic flow in Langflow.

This template has an [**Agent** component](#agent-component) that is connected to two other components as tools through the agent's **Tools** port.
The LLM specified in the **Agent** component's settings can use its own built-in functionality as well as the functionality provided by the connected tools when generating responses.

For a multi-agent example see [Use an agent as a tool](/agents-tools#use-an-agent-as-a-tool).

## Agent component {#agent-component}

The **Agent** component is the primary agent actor in your agentic flows.
This component uses an LLM integration to respond to input, such as a chat message or file upload.

The agent can use the tools already available in the base LLM model as well as additional tools that you connect to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port.

You can connect any Langflow component as a tool, including other **Agent** components and MCP servers through the [**MCP Tools** component](#mcp-connection).
For more information and examples, see [Use Langflow agents](/agents) and [Configure tools for agents](/agents-tools).

### Agent component parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| agent_llm | Dropdown | Input parameter. The provider of the language model that the agent uses to generate responses. Options include OpenAI and other providers or Custom. |
| system_prompt | String | Input parameter. The system prompt provides initial instructions and context to guide the agent's behavior. |
| tools | List | Input parameter. The list of tools available for the agent to use. This field is optional and can be empty. |
| input_value | String | Input parameter. The input task or question for the agent to process. |
| add_current_date_tool | Boolean | Input parameter. When true this adds a tool to the agent that returns the current date. |
| memory | Memory | Input parameter. An optional memory configuration for maintaining conversation history. |
| max_iterations | Integer | Input parameter. The maximum number of iterations the agent can perform. |
| handle_parsing_errors | Boolean | Input parameter. This determines whether to handle parsing errors during agent execution. |
| verbose | Boolean | Input parameter. This enables verbose output for detailed logging. |
| response | Message | Output parameter. The agent's response to the given input task. |

## MCP Tools component {#mcp-connection}

The **MCP Tools** component connects to a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server and exposes the MCP server's functions as tools for Langflow agents to use to respond to input.

In addition to connecting to any of the many MCP servers available online and your own custom-built MCP servers, you can also leverage your own Langflow flows as MCP tools by connecting to the MCP server for a [Langflow project](/concepts-flows#projects).
To do this, use the **MCP Tools** component's [SSE mode](/mcp-client#mcp-sse-mode) to connect to your Langflow MCP server at the `/api/v1/mcp/sse` endpoint.

For more information, see [Use Langflow as an MCP client](/mcp-client) and [Use Langflow as an MCP server](/mcp-server).

### Earlier versions of the MCP Tools component

* In Langflow version 1.5, the **MCP Connection** component was renamed to the **MCP Tools** component.
* In Langflow version 1.3, the **MCP Tools (stdio)** and **MCP Tools (SSE)** components were deprecated and replaced by the unified **MCP Connection** component, which was later renamed to **MCP Tools**.
