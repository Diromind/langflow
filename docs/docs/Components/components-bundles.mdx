Bundles contain custom components that support specific third-party integrations with Langflow.
Bundles are derived from the core Langflow components so you can add them to your flows and configure them in the same way as the core components.

Many Bundles are developed by third-party contributors to the Langflow codebase.
Some providers contribute documentation with their bundles, whereas others document their bundles in their own documentation.
Some bundles have no documentation.

The Langflow documentation focuses on using bundles within flows.
For that reason, it focuses on the Langflow-specific configuration steps for bundled components.
For information about provider-specific features or APIs, see the provider's documentation.

## Use both core components and bundles

Some core components don't require you to use a specific provider.
Other core components support multiple third-party providers.

If you are looking for a specific service or integration, try searching the **Components** menu or browsing both the core components and bundles.

If all else fails, you can always create your own [custom components](/components-custom-components).

## Legacy bundles

The following bundles contain only legacy components.
This means that you can still use these components in your flows, but they are no longer maintained and they can be removed in future releases.

### CrewAI bundle

The CrewAI bundle contains components based on the [**Agent** core component](/agents).

These components represent CrewAI agents, allowing for the creation of specialized AI agents with defined roles goals and capabilities within a crew.
For more information, see the [CrewAI agents documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Agents/).

* **Hierarchical Task**
* **Sequential Task**
