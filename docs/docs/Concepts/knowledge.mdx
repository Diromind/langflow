A knowledge base is a repository of vector embeddings created from your data that agents can reference to answer domain-specific questions.
Knowledge bases are distinct from vector database components.
Knowledge bases store vector data locally, and each knowledge base can be re-used in new flows without requiring re-ingestion of the data in every flow.
You create a new knowledge base with the [**Create Knowledge**](/components-data#create-knowledge) component, and then retrieve knowledge using the [**Retrieve Knowledge**](/components-data#retrieve-knowledge) component.

For example, you could create a knowledge base with customer sales data from a specific month.
Then, whenever you create flows that need customer data from this time period, add a [**Retrieve Knowledge**](/components-data#retrieve-knowledge) component to your flow to access the knowledge base.

## Create knowledge using the knowledge base ingest component

To view your available Knowledge bases, click <Icon name="Books" aria-hidden="true"/> **Knowledge**.

1. To create a new knowledge base, click <Icon name="Add" aria-hidden="true"/> **Create Knowledge**.
You can also create new knowledge bases with the <Icon name="Add" aria-hidden="true"/> **New Knowledge** option in the **Create Knowledge** component.
2. In the **Knowledge Base** field, select an existing Knowledge Base, or select <Icon name="Add" aria-hidden="true"/> **New knowledge**.
Complete the fields in the **Create new knowledge base** pane, and then click **Create**.

    * **Knowledge Base Name**: The name of your knowledge base
    * **Model Name**: The embedding model for embedding your vector data.
    * **API Key**: The API key for your embedding model.

On Mac, knowledge base files are stored at `home/.langflow/knowledge_bases`.
The contents of a `/knowledge_base` folder are:

    ```text
    knowledge_base/
      ├── schema.json
      ├── source.parquet
      └── vectors.py
    ```

### Ingest knowledge in a flow

This example uses the Ingest Knowledge component to store chunks of text retrieved with the [**URL** component](/components-data#url).

1. Connect a [**URL** component](/components-data#url), a [**Split Text** component](/components-processing#split-text), and a [**Ingest Knowledge Base** component](/components-data#ingest-knowledge-base).

    * The **URL** component's **Extract Pages** port is connected to the **Split Text** component's **Input** port.
    * The **Split Text** component's **Chunks** port is connected toi the **Ingest Knowledge** component's **Data** port.

2. To ingest the content into the knowledge base, in the [**Ingest Knowledge Base** component](/components-data#ingest-knowledge-base), click <Icon name="Play" aria-hidden="true" /> **Run Component**.
3. Navigate to the **Knowledge Bases** page.
Your new knowledge is available.

## Use knowledge in a flow

To use a knowledge base in a flow, include a [**Retrieve Knowledge Base** component](/components-data#retrieve-knowledge-base), and connect it to a component that accepts a DataFrame.
You can re-use knowledge bases whenever you need them, so you don't have to re-ingest vectors or load more files in each flow that uses your data.

1. Connect a [**Chat Input** component](/components-io) to a **Knowledge Base Retrieval** component, and the KB Retrieval component's output to a [**Chat Output** component](/components-io).
{/*![A knowledge base ingestion flow](/img/knowledge-ingest.png) commented out until merged*/}

2. In the **Knowledge Base** field, select your knowledge base.
If your knowledge base isn't available, click <Icon name="Refresh" aria-hidden="true"/> **Refreshe** to refresh the field.
3. Open the **Playground**, and query your knowledge base.
The chat returns similar search, including similarity scores.
To modify the retrieval, toggle parameters through the <Icon name="SlidersHorizontal" aria-hidden="true"/> **Controls** in the [component's header menu](/concepts-components#component-menus).                          |
