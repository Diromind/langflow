Composio components in Langflow provide [Composio](https://app.composio.dev/) tools to your **Agent** components.

Instead of juggling multiple integrations and components in your flow, connect Composio components to an **Agent** component to use all of Composio's supported APIs and actions as tools for your agent.

The Composio bundle includes a **Composio Tools** component that provides access to all Composio tools through a unified interface.
Individual services like Gmail, GitHub, and Slack are also available as individual components, which authenticate and integrate with Composio the same way as the **Composio Tools** component.

For information about specific Composio functionality, see the [Composio documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/intro/overview).

## Authentication for Composio components

Composio components require authentication to Composio with a Composio API key.

Depending on the components you use, you may also need additional access, such as an OpenAI API key, Gmail account, or GitHub account.

## Use the Composio Tools component in a flow

Connect a **Composio Tools** component to an **Agent** component to enable your agent to use Gmail functionality.

1. In Langflow, create a Simple Agent starter flow.

2. Add a **Composio Tools** component to the flow.

3. Connect the **Agent** component's **Tools** port to the **Composio Tools** component's **Tools** port.

4. In the **Agent** component, enter your OpenAI API key or configure the **Agent** component to use a different LLM.
5. In the **Composio API Key** field, enter your Composio API key.

6. In the **Tool Name** field, select the tool you want your agent to have access to.

    For this example, select the **Gmail** tool to allow your agent to control an email account with the **Composio Tools** component.

7. In the **Actions** field, select the action you want the agent to take with the **Gmail** tool.

    The **Gmail** tool supports multiple actions, and it also supports multiple actions within the same tool.
    For this example, select **GMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT**.
    For more information, see the [Composio documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/patterns/tools/use-tools/use-specific-actions).

    At this point your flow has three connected components:

    * The **Chat Input** component is connected to the **Agent** component's **Input** port. This allows the flow to be triggered by an incoming prompt from a user or application.
    * The **Composio Tools** component with the Gmail tool is connected to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port. The agent may not use this tool for every request; the agent only uses this connection if it decides the Gmail tool can help respond to the prompt.
    * The **Agent** component's **Output** port is connected to the **Chat Output** component, which returns the final response to the user or application.

8. To test the connection to Composio, click **Playground**, and then ask the LLM about the tools available to it.
The agent should provide a list of connected tools, including the **Gmail** tool and the built-in tools in the **Agent** component.

    ```text
    User:
    What tools are available to you?

    AI:
    I have access to the following tools:

    1. **GMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT**: This tool allows me to create a draft email using Gmail's API. I can specify the recipient's email address, subject, body content, and whether the body content is HTML.

    2. **CurrentDate-get_current_date**: This tool retrieves the current date and time in a specified timezone.
    ```

9. To test the specific Composio tool, tell the agent to perform an action like writing a draft email:

    ```text
    Create a draft email with the subject line "Greetings from Composio"
    recipient: "your.email@address.com"
    Body content: "Hello from composio!"
    ```

    The **Playground** displays the logic as the agent chooses the `GMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT` tool to create the email draft.
    This example response is abbreviated.

    ```text
    The draft email with the subject "Greetings from Composio" and body "Hello from composio!" has been successfully created.
    ```

    ```json
    {
      "recipient_email": "your.email@address.com",
      "subject": "Greetings from Composio",
      "body": "Hello from composio!",
      "is_html": false
    }

    {
      "data": {
        "response_data": {
          "id": "r-237981011463568567",
          "message": {
            "id": "195dd80528171132",
            "threadId": "195dd80528171132",
            "labelIds": [
              "DRAFT"
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      "error": null,
      "successfull": true,
      "successful": true
    }
    ```

10. For further confirmation, go to your Gmail account and find the message in your drafts folder.

11. To add more Composio actions, add more Composio components to your flow, and then connect them to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port.
