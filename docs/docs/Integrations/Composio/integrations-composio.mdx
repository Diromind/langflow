[Bundles](/components-bundle-components) contain custom components that support specific third-party integrations with Langflow.

This page describes the components that are available in the **Composio** bundle.

Composio components in Langflow provide [Composio](https://app.composio.dev/) tools to your **Agent** components.
Individual services like Gmail, GitHub, and Slack are also available as individual components.

For information about specific Composio functionality, see the [Composio documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/intro/overview).

## Authentication for Composio components

Composio components require authentication to Composio with a Composio API key.

Depending on the components you use, you may also need additional access, such as an OpenAI API key, Gmail account, or GitHub account.

For information about specific Composio functionality, see the [Composio documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/intro/overview).

## Use a Composio Gmail component in a flow

Connect a Composio **Gmail** component to an **Agent** component to enable your agent to use Gmail functionality.
Other Composio tools will connect the same way, and use the same parameters, but may require different API keys in Composio.

1. In Langflow, create a Simple Agent starter flow.

2. Add a Composio **Gmail** component to the flow.

3. Connect the **Agent** component's **Tools** port to the Composio **Gmail** component's **Tools** port.

4. In the **Agent** component, enter your OpenAI API key or configure the **Agent** component to use a different LLM.
5. In the **Composio API Key** field, enter your Composio API key.
6. In the Composio **Gmail** component, enable **Tool Mode**.
The **Actions** field populates with the actions available to the Agent, which it will choose from based on your request.

    At this point your flow has three connected components:

    * The **Chat Input** component is connected to the **Agent** component's **Input** port. This allows the flow to be triggered by an incoming prompt from a user or application.
    * The Composio **Gmail** component with the Gmail tool is connected to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port. The agent may not use this tool for every request; the agent only uses this connection if it decides the Gmail tool can help respond to the prompt.
    * The **Agent** component's **Output** port is connected to the **Chat Output** component, which returns the final response to the user or application.

8. To test the connection to Composio, click **Playground**, and then ask the LLM about the tools available to it.
The agent should provide a list of connected tools, including the **Gmail** tool and the built-in tools in the **Agent** component.

    ```text
    User:
    What tools are available to you?

    I have access to a variety of tools that allow me to help you with different tasks. Here are the main categories of tools available to me:

    1. Gmail Tools:
       - Fetch emails, search, and filter messages.
       - Fetch specific email details by message ID.
       - Create email drafts (with attachments, HTML, CC/BCC, etc.).
       - Delete email drafts or specific messages.

    2. Date & Time Tools:
       - Get the current date and time in any timezone.

    3. Multi-Tool Use:
       - Run multiple tools in parallel for efficiency.

    If you have a specific task in mind, let me know and I can tell you which tool I would use or demonstrate how I can help!
    ```

9. To test a specific action, tell the agent to perform an action like writing a draft email:

    ```text
    Create a draft email with the subject line "Greetings from Composio"
    recipient: "your.email@address.com"
    Body content: "Hello from composio!"
    ```

    The **Playground** displays the logic as the agent chooses the `GMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT` tool to create the email draft.
    This example response is abbreviated.

    ```text
    The draft email with the subject "Greetings from Composio" and body "Hello from composio!" has been successfully created.
    ```

    ```json
    {
      "recipient_email": "your.email@address.com",
      "subject": "Greetings from Composio",
      "body": "Hello from composio!",
      "is_html": false
    }

    {
      "data": {
        "response_data": {
          "id": "r-237981011463568567",
          "message": {
            "id": "195dd80528171132",
            "threadId": "195dd80528171132",
            "labelIds": [
              "DRAFT"
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      "error": null,
      "successfull": true,
      "successful": true
    }
    ```

10. For further confirmation, go to your Gmail account and find the message in your drafts folder.

11. To add more Composio actions, add more Composio components to your flow, and then connect them to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port.

For information about specific Composio functionality, see the [Composio documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/intro/overview).

### Composio tools parameters

All Composio tools share the same parameter structure in Langflow, but they may require different API keys or authentication methods within the Composio platform.
